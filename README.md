## Mock App Store Description

App Name: PhysiBoard

App Description:

PhysiBoard is a physics based sound toy, that’s also a bit like a keyboard. 

There are boxes, balls and walls. Moving the green and orange balls, and the red spinning square changes the sound of the keyboard. The other boxes are just there for fun.

Physics Controls
• Green ball height controls volume.
• Orange ball height controls brightness.
• Red box spin speed controls vibrato.
• Slide the red box sideways to make the vibrato larger!
• Use the extra boxes to change how the other objects behave.

Keyboard
• Two octaves containing the same notes as a normal keyboard.
• Slide your fingers across the rows!
• Octave and sound adjust buttons.

There are no rules, play with PhysiBoard your own way!

- PhysiBoard is a real synthesiser which uses Frequency Modulation (FM) synthesis.

- Future updates coming with more physics sandboxes!
